## Guidelines for code submission  
1. All the code should reside in the `src/` folder.
2. Please name the class/file as descriptive as possible, such that it would reflect the Question statements.
3. If the solution for a particular question exist then just add a number to indicate that it's another version. For example, if a solution exist as `findPrime.java` then name your version of same code as `findPrime2.java`
4. Put your name as a comment in the top of the file along with date and questions.
For example,
```java
// Question 1: Find primes between 45 and 700
// Your Name
// Date: 28/03/22
```
